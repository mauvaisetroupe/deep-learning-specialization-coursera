# Deep L-layer Neural Network

Analyze the key computations underlying deep learning, then use them to build and train deep neural networks for computer vision tasks.

Learning Objectives
- Describe the successive block structure of a deep neural network
- Build a deep L-layer neural network
- Analyze matrix and vector dimensions to check neural network implementations
- Use a cache to pass information from forward to back propagation
- Explain the role of hyperparameters in deep learning
- Build a 2-layer neural network

## Deep L-layer Neural Network

Welcome to the fourth week of this course. By now, you've seen 
- forward propagation and back propagation in the context of a neural network, with a single hidden layer, 
- logistic regression, 
- vectorization, 
- and when it's important to initialize the ways randomly. 

If you've done the past couple weeks homework, you've also implemented and seen some of these ideas work for yourself

## Forward Propagation in a Deep Network

## Getting your Matrix Dimensions Right

## Why Deep Representations?

## Building Blocks of Deep Neural Networks

## Forward and Backward Propagation

## Parameters vs Hyperparameters

## What does this have to do with the brain?
